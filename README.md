### Tic Tac Toe

Our implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game allows a single player to play against a computer. We make a request to the Tic Tac Toe API to generate a position in our grid which will be the computer's move. A score section shows how many times a player has won.

### Snake

Our implementation of the snake game allows a single player to control the snake which appears as a white circle. The player can then control the snake's movements with keyboard arrow keys. The goal is to eat as many red circles as possible without hitting the grid's edges or colliding with the snake's tail.

## About
This project was inspired by the retro style and all online gaming websites. We made I'm Bored with the idea of being able to play games as easily as going to a website, without the need of loggin in.
